# vm-cloud-config

Procedure to configure a vm-cloud on a server with zsh/bash:

- creating ssh-key pair
- deactivating password login
- login with a SSH-key only
- installing nginx
  
</br>

## 1. Create SSH-key pair on local machine

> [!NOTE]
> The ED25519 key pair is a modern alternative to RSA keys and should be used. 

#### Create key

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519

#### Define path to store the key

    ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

#### Check if key pair is stored in defined path

    ls ~/.ssh

</br>

## 2. First login on V-Server from local machine

#### Login with ssh command

    ssh <username>@<ip>

#### Confirm the question with "yes" to use the new fingerprint and enter server password
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes

#### Output on successful login üëçüèª
    Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.15.0-107-generic x86_64) ...

</br>

## 3. Add the public key to the VM from local maschine

> [!IMPORTANT]
To copy the public key to the vm use the programm `ssh-copy-id` on local terminal:

    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub username@ip

#### Output on successfully adding the public key on vm üëçüèª
```
Number of key(s) added: 1
Now try logging into the machine, with: "ssh 'username@ip'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
```

#### Try to login with ssh key without password

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <username>@<ip>

#### Check storage path of key on server

    ls -al ~/.ssh

#### Show content of file `authorized_keys`

> [!NOTE]
> The public key should stored in this file

    cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

</br>

## 4. Disable password-login on server

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Disable the password-login on V-Server, since it can be unsafe. The SSH-key pair is a safe authorization method.
> Using of `sudo` to edit the `sshd-config` with nano 

    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

#### Remove the hastag before `PasswordAuthentication` and set the value to `no`

```
...
PasswordAuthentication no
...
```

#### Restart ssh.service after changes are done

    sudo systemctl restart ssh.service

#### Check if config on server works

First check (login works ‚úÖ):

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 <username>@<ip>

Double check (permission denied ‚ùå):

    ssh -o PubkeyAuthentication=no <username>@<ip>

Expected output, if everything works well:

    Permission denied (publickey).

</br>

## 4. Installing of nginx on server

#### First update the packetmanager `apt` and then install `nginx`

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install nginx -y

#### Check status of `nginx.service`

    systemctl status nginx.service     

#### Check if nginx webserver is active by connecting to ip with webbrowser
